# Off-by-one Error in Dart List Iteration
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating over a list. The error arises from incorrectly handling the loop termination condition, leading to an attempt to access an index beyond the bounds of the list.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful index management when working with lists in Dart.
